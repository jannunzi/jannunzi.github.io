        <h1>COURSE GOALS</h1>
        Discusses Web development for sites that are dynamic, data driven, and interactive. Focuses on the software development issues of integrating multiple languages, assorted data technologies, and Web interaction. Considers HTTP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, and Web services.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2>Lectures</h2>
        Lectures will focus on developing a practical understanding of Web application development. The assignments are used as an example of applying the concepts to solve a practical problem.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2>Assignments</h2>
        The assignments consist of building a complete Web application using various technologies. The assignments give students the opportunity to practice what is discussed in class to achieve a practical level of understanding of the concepts.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2>Team Project</h2>
        Students are encouraged to form teams of up to three members to collaborate on a team project due at the end of the semester. The team project will allow students to collaboratively complete a Web application from start to finish, including design & creation/optimization, as well as a dynamic user-interface.

        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2>Make-Up Policy</h2>
        <p>
        All assignments and project milestones are due at midnight on their due date. Late submissions will be penalized one percent for every hour late. For example, an on-time submission might receive a grade of 90 points. The same assignment submitted 5 hours after the deadline would be deducted 5 points and receive an 85.
        Students who miss scheduled quizzes or exams will not, as a matter of course, be able to make up those exams. If there is a legitimate reason why a student will not be able to complete an assignment on time or not be present for an exam, then they should contact the instructor beforehand. Under extreme circumstances, as decided on a case-by-case basis by the instructor, students may be allowed to make up assignments or exams without first informing the instructor. Assignments might have bonus options that can be completed at any time to compensate for missed work.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2>Assignments</h2>
        <p>
        Submissions will be made via Blackboard. Each assignment will have instructions on what to submit, but generally you will submit a link to a github repository and/or an online hosted server running a Web application. Code is expected to be professional and properly documented; any required data files and library dependencies must be resolvable via pom.xml or package.json files. All source code must be available through the school's github repository. Instructors must be able to clone your repository, build, and run your project from their local environments.

        This class has very strict standards for borrowing code: if you borrow anything for use in your assignment/project, you must have a citation, even if it's your own code from previous semesters and/or other courses. A good guideline is that if you take more than three lines of code from some source, you must include the information on where it came from. A URL or a notation (e.g., "MATLAB help files") is fine. If it is an entire function, note it at the beginning of the code segment and include any original credit information. Provide a qualitative description of what you used, and what you changed/contributed. If you have a question about what is considered a violation of this policy, ASK!

        The university's academic integrity policy discusses actions regarded as violations and consequences for students: http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity

        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of the project is to gain hands-on experience with developing a full Web application from the ground up. The project should be conducted in groups of 1-3 people. Completion of the project will include milestones in the schedule below.
